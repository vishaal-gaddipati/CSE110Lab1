## About Me

Hi, my name is **Vishaal Gaddipati** and I am a **third-year _Mathematics-Computer Science_ major** at _UCSD_. Some of my hobbies are tennis, watching movies, playing board games, and hiking.
I also enjoy spending some of my free time on traveling and photography. Here's a couple of pictures I've taken:

### About Programming
As a programmer, I am most familiar with ***Java and C++***. I've taken courses in Recommender Systems and Computer Graphics, both of which I enjoyed thoroughly. Having to create a Raytracer from scratch in C++ was definitely the most challenging thing I have done thus far. I look forward to gaining experience when it comes to programming as a team.

Most Used Languages Ranked:
1. Java
2. C++
3. Python

Topics I look forward to learning more about:
- HTML
* CSS
+ JavaScript

My goals for the quarter in CSE 110 are to:
- [ ] Understand the process of software engineering
- [ ] Create a project that follows proper SE practice
- [ ] Maintain an efficient and welcoming team environment
